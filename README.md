# Project idea
GroceryMind is a smart food inventory management system that helps users list grocery items, track expiry dates, and receive reminders before food goes bad. It also includes a smart shopping list feature, ensuring users only buy what they need, reducing waste, and saving money.

# Project background/Business Opportunity
The worldwide problem of food waste creates economic and environmental harm simultaneously. Most homes face challenges in managing their grocery maintenance that results in both accidental buying of duplicate items and discarding food without proper usage until expiration. Unnecessary waste of food from this practice causes a negative impact on SDG 12 which stands for Responsible Consumption & Production.

The digital food inventory and automated expiry reminders available on GroceryMind help users generate optimized shopping lists that consider their current food stock. This system provides smarter food stock tracking than traditional paper lists or basic note-taking applications and helps users reduce waste while promoting sustainable shopping practices.

A smart grocery management solution becomes increasingly vital at present due to growing food costs alongside worldwide sustainability requirements. Households can use GroceryMind as an efficient food management system that saves money and promotes environmental sustainability.
